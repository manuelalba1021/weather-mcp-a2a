> **Next-Generation Agentic AI** powered by the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and **Llama 3 (Groq)**. A real-time, multi-modal weather intelligence system that bridges the gap between Large Language Models and deterministic data tools.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **Weather MCP Agent** is a state-of-the-art implementation of the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, designed to demonstrate the future of AI interoperability. Unlike traditional chatbots that hallucinate data, this agent uses a standardized protocol to "connect" to live tools—fetching real-time weather forecasts, alerts, and atmospheric analytics for **any city on Earth**.

Built on **Streamlit** for a reactive UI and powered by **Groq's LPU** for near-instant inference, this system showcases how **Agentic AI** can orchestrate complex workflows (Geocoding -> Weather API -> Conversational Synthesis) in milliseconds.

### 🌟 Key Capabilities
*   **🌍 Global Coverage**: Instant weather intelligence for 100,000+ cities worldwide.
*   **⚡ Hyper-Fast Inference**: Uses Llama 3 70B on Groq LPUs for sub-second reasoning.
*   **🔌 Standardized Tooling**: Built 100% on the open-source MCP standard.
*   **🗣️ Multi-Modal Input**: Supports both Text and Voice (WebRTC) interaction.
*   **🧠 Smart Context**: Maintains conversation history and context-aware responses.
